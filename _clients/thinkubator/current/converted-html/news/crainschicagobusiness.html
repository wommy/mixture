<p>Thinkubator Ranked as one of Chicago’s Best Meeting Spaces for Idea-Generation by Crain’s Chicago Business<br />
The venue removes employees from their typical office settings and put them in a space that will ignite their imaginations.</p>

<h2>THINKUBATOR</h2>

<p><strong>Capacity:</strong> The main room can seat 20 to 40 people.</p>

<p><strong>Cost:</strong> A day’s rental is a flat fee of $2,500 to $4,500 and includes supplies and technology services. Guests can order breakfast, lunch or dinner from any number of nearby restaurants for an additional fee.</p>

<p><strong>Why:</strong> The Thinkubator studio is a creative haven in the West Loop neighborhood of Fulton Market. Its loft-style space has 19-foot ceilings, a winding staircase to the building’s rooftop terrace, exposed brick walls and large windows that showcase the Chicago skyline. The idea is to turn the typical work environment on its side. “Cubical creativity is such a big challenge,” says President Gerald Haman, whose primary business is an innovation and creativity coaching company called SolutionPeople. “The size of people’s ideas is proportional to the size of perceived space they think they have to think.” Mr. Haman uses functional art in the shape of question marks, red lip-shaped chairs and an Einstein-themed bathroom to invoke guests’ creative side. Staff even will arrange for the Good Humor ice cream truck to stop by for a surprise mid-afternoon snack to spark memories of childhood. In the future, The Thinkubator will expand to include a 1,500-square-foot space called the Aha Spa, which will be decorated with themes from nature.</p>
