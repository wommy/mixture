__Take a break from traditional conference, hotel or “bored” rooms and experience Chicago’s “Most Creative Meeting Space”.__

Since 1989, thousands of people have enjoyed innovative and creative meetings, workshops, facilitations, retreats and special events at our comfortable, unique and thought-provoking Thinkubator.

__“If you want people to think outside the box, do NOT put their brains in a box.”__
- Gerald “Solutionman” Haman, Thinkubator Founder

Located in downtown Chicago, a mile from the Loop and two miles from the Magnificent Mile, the Thinkubator offers comfortable and interesting furniture in an elegant loft environment. Our dazzling skyline view of Chicago and café-style  seating on our private rooftop deck inspires blue-sky thinking and offers a refreshing brain break to guests. Too cold to be outside? Enjoy a crackling wood-burning fire while the piano player plays music in the background or sing your favorite Karaoke songs under our spinning disco ball! Get more work done while having fun! Stimulate your team’s brainpower with our facilitation resources, the latest AV technology and innovation  tools that deliver meaningful and measurable results.
