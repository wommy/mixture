<h2>Making Your Environment Inspirational</h2>

<p>Can a person’s physical environment affect innovation?</p>

<p>Alex F. Osborn, a pioneer in the field of deliberate creativity, believed the answer was a resounding “Yes.”</p>

<p>“Urban life tends to sap imaginative strength in all except the few who work in the arts and in creative phases of business and science,” he wrote in ‘Applied Imagination: Principles and procedures of Creative Problem-Solving,” first published in 1953.</p>

<p>To counter the negative effects of this “urbanization,” Osborn challenged people to take deliberate steps “to conserve and develop the imaginative talents with which we are born.”</p>

<p>One natural step: Redesign and deinstitutionalize the work environment so that it fosters creative thinking.</p>

<p>“I have long recognized that the external environment influences what goes on inside the head,” said Gerald “Solutionman” Haman, a creativity expert based in Chicago. Thousands of business people who’ve visited Haman’s ‘Thinkubator” – a creative meeting space reminiscent of a colorful kindergarten playroom stocked with adult-size gadgets, toys, tools, fun furniture and supplies – say they’ve saved 40% to 60% of their time generating ideas in the creative environment vs. the cold office space in which they spend their days.</p>

<p><strong>Why do people find the Thinkubator’s environment so stimulating? In part because the meeting space excites all five senses. Among other things, it features:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Ergonomically designed chairs – that simulates floating, simultaneously soothing and stimulating the mind.</li>
  <li>Hundreds of toys and creativity tools – from modeling clay to crayons to wall-size, printer-ready whiteboards.</li>
  <li>The relaxing scent of lavender, peppermint and other aromas.</li>
  <li>A variety of sounds, including music that brainstormers can make themselves using the Thinkubator’s grand piano or karaoke machines.</li>
</ul>

<p>“By fostering a diversity of stimulation, you get more diversity of thought and a wider variety of creative ideas,” Haman said.</p>
