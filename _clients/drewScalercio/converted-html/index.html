				<p>"Andrew Scalercio is an absolutely excellent agent. Within hours of agreeing to hire him, he had listings for me look through in the Century21 MLS portal, ideas to discuss, and things to consider which I hadn't previously thought of. Each of his recommendations turned out to be huge factors in my decision!</p>
				<p>He was always polite, eager to help and accessible as soon as I needed to get in touch. If I had any questions regarding different locations, neighborhoods, access to transit, nearby amenities or attractions, he always came through with the best possible answers. He drove me around to each different site and walked through the properties with me- offering feedback, observations, things to consider, and honest opinions.</p>
				<p>His great attributes are his honesty, deep knowledge of my area of search, accessibility, communication, and willingness to listen to my inquiries. I'm a pretty picky home buyer to say the least. We looked through a lot places before I found one that suited me. He acted swiftly to broker the deal and help navigate me through putting in the best and strongest offer for the property despite other potential buyers who had an interest. He put me in touch with an excellent lender (who I would write an equally glowing review for), and a great inspector for the property.</p>
				<p>I recommend him for all the above reasons. You won't regret your decision to hire Andrew Scalercio. Although he's a relatively new agent in the business, you wouldn't know it from dealing with him. â€œ</p>
