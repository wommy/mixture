> simple

transparency

a few websites that have inspired me:

\- a teacher of mine, one of the first websites i encountered that put [function over form](//ims21.net/web_form_function.htm)

> <https://itemsandthings.com/>  
\-  one of my favorite music labels. their brand's dedication to minimalism is conveyed thoroughly, from their music to their web design.  

> <https://www.wanna-rework.de/>  
\- one of the musicians on the above label
