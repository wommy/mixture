here im going to describe my stack
software used to create my platform

design develop deploy data

i do all my coding in sublime text

i built this on mixture
    ruby
    liquid
        shopify built /  is built in on for
    markdown

it auto minimifies css imgs and scripts
it creates a local host on my computer, taking away the needs for a MAMP stack
it exports to html
it ftps
it supports haml and scss
you can have two different views for the same content
it auto generates sitemaps and navigation bars
it auto populates feeds from folders
it supports routes and templates
it does it all



my biggest weakness is volition
ive done this all by myself
that fact that ive gotten so far without help is astonishing
if i had some friends in my field i would have gotten so much farther
