so a friend of mine asked me what my portfolio does

i told him exactly what its always been

i want to host artists digital media online
they will be my media

froggie92 was the old me,
the nerd in high school
whose life was video games and anime
runescape
and counter strike
and diablo 2 lord of destruction
and half life 2
and dota

who remembers longcat from 4chan in 2006

who liked the matrix

that me isnt dead
that me is the charmander to my current charmeleon

yeah i still like anime and video games
but thats not my life

i bike around chicago instead of driving around detroit
i like the bike: its cheap, practical, accessible

i used to like happy hardcore and hardstyle
now i like detroit techno and house
but i still go to mc chris concerts

the college friends of mine will know the mc chris hoodie i wore for years straight
my college friends will know my striped shirt
now i wear a detroit sweatshirt

froggie92 me used to want there to be public transport in detroit
wommy tilliams me knows it exists already, the buses
and that the light rail is the biggest waste of money

wommy tilliams knows detroit water tastes better than chicago water

but wommy tilliams isnt the end of the line
charmeleon evolves into charizard

i want to be international, 
travel for work, instead of work to travel
working anywhere and everywhere
living anywhere and everywhere
you can get a bike anywhere

i already practically live out of a backpack
and at the end of the day i can defend myself

my whole life
i have been taking the steps to become this
and i didnt even know

and its going to happen,
    not if, but how when where
who will help me will be rewarded

i want to be the tech nomad
tech nomad is who i want to be

help me become the next me
-
branding to me is the easiest way to split myself into past present future imperfect
