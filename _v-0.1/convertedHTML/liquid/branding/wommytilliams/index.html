<p>my name has evolved numerous times throughout my life</p>

<p>in grade school, all my friends called me tommy<br />
when i got to middle school, i shortened it to tom</p>

<p>i later realized that all my close friends called me tommy<br />
so i switched my facebook name to tommy williams<br />
over night, all the people i barely knew started addressing me as tommy</p>

<p>the newest iteration, wommytilliams came about in college<br />
a bad breakup was causing me to be negative</p>

<p>people started joking that i had some type of alter ego<br />
if tommy williams was dr jekyll, wommy was mr hyde </p>

<p>“wommy” was really taking off<br />
yet it served reference to this aspect of myself i didnt like<br />
so i did the only thing i could<br />
i took it back</p>

<p>i bought <a href="http://wommytilliams.com">http://wommytilliams.com</a></p>

<p>wommy tilliams’ uniqueness is a double-edged sword<br />
visually, wommy tilliams is relatively easy to get<br />
auditorily, it sounds like a jarbled nothing </p>

<p>brand wise<br />
if you know tommy williams, wommy tilliams isn’t too hard to get</p>

<p>if your first move  explain your brand, </p>
